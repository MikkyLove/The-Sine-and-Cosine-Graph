# The-Sine-and-Cosine-Graph

This is a simple math project done using the matplotlib module, together with the numpy module in python.

The numpy module was used to generate the array of values for both the vertical axis and the horizantal axis of the graph.

The matplotlib module is responsible for the plotting and visible layout.

In summary, the code draws the sine and cosine graph!
